# Analysis of feasible compositions 

This folder contains postprocessing scripts used to analyze and visualize
screened and CALPHAD-revalidated alloy compositions in the **AlloyOracle**
workflow. The scripts here were used to generate several figures/tables in the
manuscript and Supplementary Information related to:

- loss-threshold / CALPHAD revalidation analysis
- composition clustering into alloy families
- VEC–strength scatter visualizations and derived trends

> Note: As Thermo-Calc license do not permit the open release of large calculated datasets, 
> only a 100-line 'dummy' version of the full set of feasible compositions (15,000 lines).
> To reproduce some of the figures in the manuscript, a license to the commercial 
> TCHEA7 database is needed.

## Contents

### Scripts
- `plot_loss_threshold_analysis.py`  
  Generates loss-threshold trade-off plots and CALPHAD revalidation summaries.

- `cluster_to_alloy_families.py`  
  Runs (or postprocesses) k-means clustering for feasible compositions and
  produces cluster assignments used for plotting / down-selection.

- `visualize_screened_compositions.py`  
  Generates stacked bar plots of nominal / A2 / B2 compositions and phase
  fractions for clustered feasible compositions.

- `scatter_plot_vec_ys.py`  
  Generates VEC vs. yield-strength scatter plots colored by
  A2 compositions and A2 misfit, as used in manuscript figure.


### Data / inputs

Inputs (generated by the screening pipeline and/or CALPHAD revalidation):
- `feasible_compositions_dummy.xlsx` (contains only 100 compositions, true data has 15,000 compositions
- `feasible_compositions_in_3_alloy_clusters.xlsx` (clustering to alloy families)
- `experimental_compositions.xlsx` (set of experimental compositions)

## Setup

Recommended environment:
- Python 3.10+ (tested with 3.12)
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`, `scikit-learn`

Example:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib openpyxl scikit-learn
